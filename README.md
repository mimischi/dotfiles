# .dotfiles

Personal dotfiles for my T460s running Arch Linux.

## Usage

Install [`rcm`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) and clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mimischi/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Next run `rcup` to symlink all dotfiles from `~/.dotfiles` to your `$HOME`.
